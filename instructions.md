# Instructions
## Prerequisites
FTP server - with sub-directories for each institution.

Access to the Developer network for all member institutions, including the remote-storage institutions.

### On all Institutions:
1. FTP connection configuration - To share files between the App and Alma with a  [sub-directory](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/050Administration/050Configuring_General_Alma_Functions/050External_Systems#UpdateSubmissionFormatFtp) for each institutions (the dir name should include the inst code. e.g. main_folder/01AAA_ABC).
2. API-key with r/w permission for the Bibs area
3. Publishing Profile - To handle items synchronization
    - Create a [set](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/050Administration/070Managing_Jobs/060Managing_Search_Queries_and_Sets#sets.setDetail) which contains all items that are located in the remote storage location.
    - Create an Items [publishing profile job](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/090Integrations_with_External_Systems/030Resource_Management/080Publishing_and_Inventory_Enrichment) with the above set. Publishing protocol should be FTP and sub-directory is "items". Compressed file extension: tar.gz
4. Remote Storage Facility - To export all requests to remote storage
    - Create a [integration profile](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/integrations/remote_storage/xml_based/)  of “remote storage” type. “Export File Path“ is "requests".
    - Create a [Remote Storage](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/030Fulfillment/080Configuring_Fulfillment/040Configuring_Remote_Storage_Facilities) conected to your integration profile.
    - Edit [Physical Location](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/030Fulfillment/080Configuring_Fulfillment/030Configuring_Physical_Locations) - Type is : Remote Storage , Remote Storage is the remote storage facility you created.
    - Find the job ID that should be used for submitting the job and add it to the app configuration. You can use this API: /almaws/v1/conf/jobs?type=SCHEDULED&limit=100 search for the integration profile name and get the id.
5.  [Webhooks](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/090Integrations_with_External_Systems/030Resource_Management/300Webhooks)
    - Create a Webhooks Integration Profile. Message type should be JSON and under Subscriptions Select `Job Finish` to send a webhook when an Alma Job is done. Webhook listener URL will be the url after deploying the app following forward slash and "webhook". E.g.:  https://alma-remote-storage-app.herokuapp.com/webhook


### On the Remote Storage Institution:
1. Create a patrons for each Institution/Library. For example if the Institution code is 01AAA_ABC and the library code is RS, the user's Primary identifier will be 01AAA_ABC-RS
2. Define [provenance code](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/040Resource_Management/080Configuring_Resource_Management/080Configuring_Provenance_Codes) for each institution code.
3. Add personal-delivery for all items' [terms of use](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/030Fulfillment/080Configuring_Fulfillment/050Physical_Fulfillment#fulfillment.tou.termsOfUseManagement)
4. Create a [Webhooks](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/090Integrations_with_External_Systems/030Resource_Management/300Webhooks) Integration Profile. Where the Message type is JSON and Under Subscriptions select `Loans`. Webhook listener URL will be (same as above) the url after deploying the app following forward slash and "webhook". E.g.:  https://alma-remote-storage-app.herokuapp.com/webhook


## Installation

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Install [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java#set-up).
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/AlmaRemoteStorageApp.git`
4. Go to the repository folder `cd AlmaRemoteStorageApp`
5. Remove .git folder
6. The file conf.json should include confidential information, so we'll not upload it to Heroku. Move `conf.json` out to the FTP server, under main-folder and update the relevant values: Gateway url, API-keys etc.
7. Commit to Git: `git init` , `git add .` , `git commit -m "Ready to deploy"`
8. Create the heroku app `heroku create “<app-name>“`
9. Add conf.json path to the [Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#using-the-heroku-dashboard) when Key=CONFIG_FILE and Value=ftp://user:password@server/path/to/conf.json
10. Deploy your code `git push heroku master`. The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running: `heroku ps:scale web=1`
11. Congratulations! Your web app should now be up and running on Heroku. If you like to test it from your browser, open it with: `heroku open`
12. The URL that now opened in your browser is the URL you need to configre in the Webhook integration profile.
13. When configuring the Webhook profile, press on "Activate". This will call the "challenge" URL: https://<alma-remote-storage-app>.herokuapp.com/webhook?challenge=123

## Maintaining historic log files
Heroku doesn't keep log files above 1500 lines. For troublshooting we added support for uploading log files to the FTP.
It is done by a job scheduled in Heroku. However since we use a free account in Heroku, scheduled jobs are not guaranteed to run.
Free dynos "sleep" after 30 minutes of inactivity. They can be waken up by calling our App URL every few minutes.
The below script can be run from any Windows PC to prevent your Heroku App from sleeping:

- RepeatCurl.bat file :
```
@echo OFF
:REPEAT
@echo. %date% at %time% >>CurlLogs.txt
curl  “https://<alma-remote-storage-app>.herokuapp.com“
timeout /t 1800 /nobreak > NUL
goto REPEAT
```
